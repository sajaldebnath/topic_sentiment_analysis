              "4  we were pleased to see how 2nd street and the ten broeck neighborhood in albany have come along its great to see all of the gorgeous brownstones including the one we stayed in being renovated and cared for br in terms of quality i was pleased by the courtesy of the host s friend who lived nearby he was there to let us in and make sure i knew to call with any problems with a full kitchen and two bedrooms my daughter and i felt at home with plenty of space as a native of albany i m used to thin windows and occasionally noisy neighbors if you don t sleep well don t take the master bedroom and be aware that loud music may be playing during the evening and weekend but there is a fan ac unit to drown out the din from the street br this space has been renovated and a vast improvement i m sure from where it was and i m hoping progress will continue here as it seemed a few projects were incomplete i would have loved to enjoy more sunlight in the house but there was a ton of tree debris in the back yard so there was no way to enjoy opening the windows br on my own this place was fine but if traveling with my child again i will probably pick a quieter location where i d be able to open windows or put her down for a nap without worrying about excessive noise  \n",

              "4  we were pleased to see how 2nd street and the ten broeck neighborhood in albany have come along its great to see all of the gorgeous brownstones including the one we stayed in being renovated and cared for br in terms of quality i was pleased by the courtesy of the host s friend who lived nearby he was there to let us in and make sure i knew to call with any problems with a full kitchen and two bedrooms my daughter and i felt at home with plenty of space as a native of albany i m used to thin windows and occasionally noisy neighbors if you don t sleep well don t take the master bedroom and be aware that loud music may be playing during the evening and weekend but there is a fan ac unit to drown out the din from the street br this space has been renovated and a vast improvement i m sure from where it was and i m hoping progress will continue here as it seemed a few projects were incomplete i would have loved to enjoy more sunlight in the house but there was a ton of tree debris in the back yard so there was no way to enjoy opening the windows br on my own this place was fine but if traveling with my child again i will probably pick a quieter location where i d be able to open windows or put her down for a nap without worrying about excessive noise   \n",

              "4  we were pleased to see how 2nd street and the ten broeck neighborhood in albany have come along its great to see all of the gorgeous brownstones including the one we stayed in being renovated and cared for br in terms of quality i was pleased by the courtesy of the host s friend who lived nearby he was there to let us in and make sure i knew to call with any problems with a full kitchen and two bedrooms my daughter and i felt at home with plenty of space as a native of albany i m used to thin windows and occasionally noisy neighbors if you don t sleep well don t take the master bedroom and be aware that loud music may be playing during the evening and weekend but there is a fan ac unit to drown out the din from the street br this space has been renovated and a vast improvement i m sure from where it was and i m hoping progress will continue here as it seemed a few projects were incomplete i would have loved to enjoy more sunlight in the house but there was a ton of tree debris in the back yard so there was no way to enjoy opening the windows br on my own this place was fine but if traveling with my child again i will probably pick a quieter location where i d be able to open windows or put her down for a nap without worrying about excessive noise   \n",

              "4  we were pleased to see how 2nd street and the ten broeck neighborhood in albany have come along its great to see all of the gorgeous brownstones including the one we stayed in being renovated and cared for br in terms of quality i was pleased by the courtesy of the host s friend who lived nearby he was there to let us in and make sure i knew to call with any problems with a full kitchen and two bedrooms my daughter and i felt at home with plenty of space as a native of albany i m used to thin windows and occasionally noisy neighbors if you don t sleep well don t take the master bedroom and be aware that loud music may be playing during the evening and weekend but there is a fan ac unit to drown out the din from the street br this space has been renovated and a vast improvement i m sure from where it was and i m hoping progress will continue here as it seemed a few projects were incomplete i would have loved to enjoy more sunlight in the house but there was a ton of tree debris in the back yard so there was no way to enjoy opening the windows br on my own this place was fine but if traveling with my child again i will probably pick a quieter location where i d be able to open windows or put her down for a nap without worrying about excessive noise   \n",
