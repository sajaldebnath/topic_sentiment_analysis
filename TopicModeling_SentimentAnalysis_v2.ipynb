Kenneth left drinks for us which was so nice. His cousin lives upstairs, and she was very nice and helpful, too. The internet only worked about half the time, and everything on the street can be heard from the main bedroom. Wonderful stay- it was exactly what we needed. It is not in the best area of town, but I never felt unsafe.    \n",

He left some supplies in the refrigerator and kindly showed us round downtown Albany. We were without a car and he arranged for his cousin Kristina to take us to  supermarket.\\r<br/>The apartment is large, clean with many original features. It is situated in an historical area that is fairly central, although like the rest of Albany you have to climb a steep hill to get to it if you are on foot. \\r<br/>   \n",

One thing to keep in mind: one bedroom is huge and the other is tiny, so if you're traveling with a friend you might have to flip a coin. :)   \n",
              "3                                                Kenneth was ready when I got there and arranged for the upstairs neighbor to meet me at the door with the keys.  Shortly after that I was left on my own in the privacy of this large 2 BR apartment - just like I like it.   I really like my privacy and there was no time at which anyone came to visit me or bother me unannounced.  At one point Kenneth had to pic up a refrigerator stored in the apartment, but the neighbor lady gave me plenty of notice and I was on my way out before he got there.  When I returned the extra refrigerator was gone and I had the nice quiet apartment to myself.  At one point I went to take a shower and found some body wash in a drawer.  That was nice since all I brought with me was shampoo.    The apartment is a city street apartment meaning that like many two family homes the BR window is feet away from the public sidewalk and you can hear people all hours of the night walking by and conversing, but its not terribly disruptive.  Overall the apartment was just what I needed and I had an enjoyable time while there.  The heat worked perfectly and the apartment was picked up.  The bed was a king size and very comfortable with sensible pillows and coverings.  The water pressure on the shower was awesome.   \n",
              "4  We were pleased to see how 2nd Street and the Ten Broeck neighborhood in Albany have come along. Its great to see all of the gorgeous brownstones, including the one we stayed in, being renovated and cared for.<br/>In terms of quality, I was pleased by the courtesy of the host's friend who lived nearby. He was there to let us in and make sure I knew to call with any problems. With a full kitchen and two bedrooms, my daughter and I felt at home with plenty of space. As a native of Albany I'm used to thin windows and occasionally noisy neighbors. If you don't sleep well, don't take the master bedroom and be aware that loud music may be playing during the evening and weekend. But there is a fan/ac unit to drown out the din from the street.<br/>This space has been renovated and a vast improvement I'm sure from where it was, and I'm hoping progress will continue here as it seemed a few projects were incomplete. I would have loved to enjoy more sunlight in the house but there was a ton of tree debris in the back yard so there was no way to enjoy opening the windows.<br/>On my own, this place was fine, but if traveling with my child again I will probably pick a quieter location where I'd be able to open windows or put her down for a nap without worrying about excessive noise.   \n",

The flat also does not have air con- the large bedroom had an obnoxiously loud fan which kept the one room cool, the rest of the house is very hot. So if you are going to stay here bear these things in mind.    \n",

We had initial difficulty in contacting the host...until we used my son who lives in Albany to be the contact, as we were relying on internet connection where ever we found free wifi..as roaming charges for international tourists is prohibitive. He went to the apartment a few times on the day we were yo arrive into JFK bit could not gain access...he was trying to get key so that he could leave basic provisions for us there. He eventually got an answer to the door bell..late evening.  The apartment was adequate for them as they spent most of their time with their brother who lives in Albany. They did say that the apartment was way too warm, and they could not see where to set the heating. One of the windows was broken but had plastic/perspex over it. The furniture was of a good enough standard but the couch was a little shabby and their was a musty smell from it. Other than those  facts they said the place was ideal for them and the contact person was very obliging considering they locked themselves out once and needed access .   \n",

Hopefully the host can fix these issues because the apartment could be nice if it is cleaned up correctly and furnished with items that weren’t all broken such as the Tv being propped up on a table with two screws.   \n",

Overall the apartment was just what I needed and I had an enjoyable time while there.  The heat worked perfectly and the apartment was picked up.

Kenneth left drinks for us which was so nice. His cousin lives upstairs, and she was very nice and helpful, too. The internet only worked about half the time, and everything on the street can be heard from the main bedroom. Wonderful stay- it was exactly what we needed. It is not in the best area of town, but I never felt unsafe.    \n",

He left some supplies in the refrigerator and kindly showed us round downtown Albany. We were without a car and he arranged for his cousin Kristina to take us to  supermarket.\\r<br/>The apartment is large, clean with many original features. It is situated in an historical area that is fairly central, although like the rest of Albany you have to climb a steep hill to get to it if you are on foot. \\r<br/>   \n",

              "3                                                Kenneth was ready when I got there and arranged for the upstairs neighbor to meet me at the door with the keys.  Shortly after that I was left on my own in the privacy of this large 2 BR apartment - just like I like it.   I really like my privacy and there was no time at which anyone came to visit me or bother me unannounced.  At one point Kenneth had to pic up a refrigerator stored in the apartment, but the neighbor lady gave me plenty of notice and I was on my way out before he got there.  When I returned the extra refrigerator was gone and I had the nice quiet apartment to myself.  At one point I went to take a shower and found some body wash in a drawer.  That was nice since all I brought with me was shampoo.    The apartment is a city street apartment meaning that like many two family homes the BR window is feet away from the public sidewalk and you can hear people all hours of the night walking by and conversing, but its not terribly disruptive.  Overall the apartment was just what I needed and I had an enjoyable time while there.  The heat worked perfectly and the apartment was picked up.  The bed was a king size and very comfortable with sensible pillows and coverings.  The water pressure on the shower was awesome.   \n",
              "4  We were pleased to see how 2nd Street and the Ten Broeck neighborhood in Albany have come along. Its great to see all of the gorgeous brownstones, including the one we stayed in, being renovated and cared for.<br/>In terms of quality, I was pleased by the courtesy of the host's friend who lived nearby. He was there to let us in and make sure I knew to call with any problems. With a full kitchen and two bedrooms, my daughter and I felt at home with plenty of space. As a native of Albany I'm used to thin windows and occasionally noisy neighbors. If you don't sleep well, don't take the master bedroom and be aware that loud music may be playing during the evening and weekend. But there is a fan/ac unit to drown out the din from the street.<br/>This space has been renovated and a vast improvement I'm sure from where it was, and I'm hoping progress will continue here as it seemed a few projects were incomplete. I would have loved to enjoy more sunlight in the house but there was a ton of tree debris in the back yard so there was no way to enjoy opening the windows.<br/>On my own, this place was fine, but if traveling with my child again I will probably pick a quieter location where I'd be able to open windows or put her down for a nap without worrying about excessive noise.   \n",

The flat also does not have air con- the large bedroom had an obnoxiously loud fan which kept the one room cool, the rest of the house is very hot. So if you are going to stay here bear these things in mind.    \n",

We had initial difficulty in contacting the host...until we used my son who lives in Albany to be the contact, as we were relying on internet connection where ever we found free wifi..as roaming charges for international tourists is prohibitive. He went to the apartment a few times on the day we were yo arrive into JFK bit could not gain access...he was trying to get key so that he could leave basic provisions for us there. He eventually got an answer to the door bell..late evening.  The apartment was adequate for them as they spent most of their time with their brother who lives in Albany. They did say that the apartment was way too warm, and they could not see where to set the heating. One of the windows was broken but had plastic/perspex over it. The furniture was of a good enough standard but the couch was a little shabby and their was a musty smell from it. Other than those  facts they said the place was ideal for them and the contact person was very obliging considering they locked themselves out once and needed access .   \n",

Hopefully the host can fix these issues because the apartment could be nice if it is cleaned up correctly and furnished with items that weren’t all broken such as the Tv being propped up on a table with two screws.   \n",

              "4  we were pleased to see how 2nd street and the ten broeck neighborhood in albany have come along its great to see all of the gorgeous brownstones including the one we stayed in being renovated and cared for br in terms of quality i was pleased by the courtesy of the host s friend who lived nearby he was there to let us in and make sure i knew to call with any problems with a full kitchen and two bedrooms my daughter and i felt at home with plenty of space as a native of albany i m used to thin windows and occasionally noisy neighbors if you don t sleep well don t take the master bedroom and be aware that loud music may be playing during the evening and weekend but there is a fan ac unit to drown out the din from the street br this space has been renovated and a vast improvement i m sure from where it was and i m hoping progress will continue here as it seemed a few projects were incomplete i would have loved to enjoy more sunlight in the house but there was a ton of tree debris in the back yard so there was no way to enjoy opening the windows br on my own this place was fine but if traveling with my child again i will probably pick a quieter location where i d be able to open windows or put her down for a nap without worrying about excessive noise   \n",

I really like my privacy and there was no time at which anyone came to visit me or bother me unannounced.  At one point Kenneth had to pic up a refrigerator stored in the apartment, but the neighbor lady gave me plenty of notice and I was on my way out before he got there.  When I returned the extra refrigerator was gone and I had the nice quiet apartment to myself.  At one point I went to take a shower and found some body wash in a drawer.  That was nice since all I brought with me was shampoo.    The apartment is a city street apartment meaning that like many two family homes the BR window is feet away from the public sidewalk and you can hear people all hours of the night walking by and conversing, but its not terribly disruptive.  Overall the apartment was just what I needed and I had an enjoyable time while there.  The heat worked perfectly and the apartment was picked up.  The bed was a king size and very comfortable with sensible pillows and coverings.  The water pressure on the shower was awesome.</td>\n",

He was there to let us in and make sure I knew to call with any problems. With a full kitchen and two bedrooms, my daughter and I felt at home with plenty of space. As a native of Albany I'm used to thin windows and occasionally noisy neighbors. If you don't sleep well, don't take the master bedroom and be aware that loud music may be playing during the evening and weekend. But there is a fan/ac unit to drown out the din from the street.&lt;br/&gt;This space has been renovated and a vast improvement I'm sure from where it was, and I'm hoping progress will continue here as it seemed a few projects were incomplete. I would have loved to enjoy more sunlight in the house but there was a ton of tree debris in the back yard so there was no way to enjoy opening the windows.&lt;br/&gt;On my own, this place was fine, but if traveling with my child again I will probably pick a quieter location where I'd be able to open windows or put her down for a nap without worrying about excessive noise.</td>\n",
